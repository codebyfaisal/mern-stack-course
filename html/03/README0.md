# Static vs Dynamic Website
## Static Website

A **static website** is a website where the content does **not change** unless a developer manually updates it. Once it's built using HTML and CSS, it stays the same for everyone.

- Content is fixed.
- Updates require changing the code.
- Example: A personal portfolio or a simple blog.

## Dynamic Website

A **dynamic website** is a website where the content **can change** based on user interaction or other conditions. It often uses programming languages and databases to update content automatically.

- Content is updated automatically or based on user input.
- Requires server-side programming.
- Example: YouTube (users can upload, delete, and view different videos).

# Website Hosting

To make your website available on the internet, you need **hosting**. Hosting means placing your website on a special computer called a **server**.

- A **server** is always connected to the internet.
- It stores your website files (HTML, CSS, images, etc.).
- You also need an **address** (called a domain name) so people can find your website.

> Think of hosting like renting a shop for your website, and the domain name is the address of that shop.

# Server

A **server** is just a computer — like your laptop or PC — but more powerful and always online.

- It stores your website files.
- It handles user requests and sends back data.
- It runs programming languages and connects to databases.

> Example: When you open a website, your browser contacts the server, asks for the page, and the server sends it back.

## Server-Side Languages

**Server-side languages** run on the server and handle things like user login, data storage, and interaction with databases.

Some common server-side languages:

- PHP
- Python
- Node.js (JavaScript on the server)
- Ruby
- Java

> These languages help process the user's request and send back the correct information to the browser.

# Website Structure (Body)

A website is made using three main technologies:

- **HTML** – the **skeleton** of the website (structure)
- **CSS** – the **skin and colors** (design)
- **JavaScript** – the **brain** (makes the website interactive)

But this structure doesn't store data. For storage, we use a **server**.

## Domain Name and IP Address

Every server has an **IP address**, like `102.83.46.7`. But these numbers are hard to remember.

So we use a **domain name**, like `www.google.com`, which is easier to remember.

> When you type a domain name in your browser:
> 1. It finds the IP address of the server.
> 2. Connects to that server.
> 3. Brings back the website content.

### Real-Life Analogy

Think of visiting a restaurant like ordering food:

- You go to **KFC** at a specific **KFC at Tehkal** → like visiting `www.kfc.com`
- You place your order on the counter or table → like requesting a web page
- You receive your food → like receiving data from the server

Same way, your browser contacts the server, asks for content, and displays it to you.
